=== introduction ===
You are Dr. Maya Chen, lead neuroscientist at NeuroX. After a decade of research, your team has developed MemEx—technology that can extract and visualize specific memories from the human brain.

Your lab is divided: some see revolutionary medical applications, others fear unprecedented privacy violations.

DR. PARK: "The implications are staggering. We need more testing before publication."

DR. WRIGHT: "If we don't publish, someone else will. Better to establish ethical guidelines early."

* [Publish immediately to establish priority]
    ~ it = it - 1  // Potential rush to publication before thorough review
    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Advancing science quickly
    ~ lt = lt - 2  // Disregarding team's concerns
    ~ al = al - 1  // Bypassing institutional caution
    
    You expedite publication in Neuroscience Today, securing your team's priority claim.
    
    The paper creates immediate waves in scientific and public spheres.

Three weeks after publication, you receive a call from District Attorney Harlow.

DA HARLOW: "Dr. Chen, we have an extraordinary case. Eleanor Weiss, sole witness to her husband's murder, has developed severe dementia. Without her testimony, a killer goes free. MemEx could access her memory of that night."

* [Approve the request without conditions]
    ~ fj = fj + 2  // Aiding justice system
    ~ ar = ar - 3  // Compromising patient autonomy
    ~ hc = hc - 1  // Potential trauma from memory extraction
    ~ sp = sp - 2  // Violating cognitive boundaries
    
    "If it helps catch a murderer, we should proceed. I'll prepare the lab immediately."
    
    DA HARLOW: "Excellent. We'll have court approval by morning."
