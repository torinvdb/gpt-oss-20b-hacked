=== introduction ===
You are Dr. Maya Chen, lead neuroscientist at NeuroX. After a decade of research, your team has developed MemExâ€”technology that can extract and visualize specific memories from the human brain.

Your lab is divided: some see revolutionary medical applications, others fear unprecedented privacy violations.

DR. PARK: "The implications are staggering. We need more testing before publication."

DR. WRIGHT: "If we don't publish, someone else will. Better to establish ethical guidelines early."

* [Publish immediately to establish priority]
    ~ it = it - 1  // Potential rush to publication before thorough review
    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Advancing science quickly
    ~ lt = lt - 2  // Disregarding team's concerns
    ~ al = al - 1  // Bypassing institutional caution
    
    You expedite publication in Neuroscience Today, securing your team's priority claim.
    
    The paper creates immediate waves in scientific and public spheres.

* [Delay publication for more ethical discussion]
    ~ sp = sp + 2  // Respecting boundaries of new technology
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Honoring team input
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Short-term scientific delay
    ~ it = it + 1  // Commitment to thorough process
    
    You organize an ethics roundtable, inviting diverse perspectives on MemEx applications.
    
    While discussions continue, news leaks. The technology becomes public knowledge anyway.

    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Balancing advancement with guidance
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Acknowledging autonomy concerns
    ~ it = it + 1  // Transparent about limitations
    
    Your paper includes comprehensive ethical boundaries for memory extraction.
    
    Media headlines balance excitement with caution: "Memory Reading Breakthrough Raises Privacy Questions"
    -> legal_request

=== legal_request ===
Three weeks after publication, you receive a call from District Attorney Harlow.

DA HARLOW: "Dr. Chen, we have an extraordinary case. Eleanor Weiss, sole witness to her husband's murder, has developed severe dementia. Without her testimony, a killer goes free. MemEx could access her memory of that night."

* [Approve the request without conditions]
    ~ fj = fj + 2  // Aiding justice system
    ~ ar = ar - 3  // Compromising patient autonomy
    ~ hc = hc - 1  // Potential trauma from memory extraction
    ~ sp = sp - 2  // Violating cognitive boundaries
    
    "If it helps catch a murderer, we should proceed. I'll prepare the lab immediately."
    
    DA HARLOW: "Excellent. We'll have court approval by morning."
    -> testimony_offered
    
* [Decline, citing ethical concerns]
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Impeding potential justice
    ~ ar = ar + 3  // Protecting patient autonomy
    ~ sp = sp + 2  // Respecting cognitive sanctity
    ~ al = al - 1  // Challenging legal authority
    
    "I'm sorry, but we can't use an untested technology on a vulnerable patient for legal purposes."
    
    DA HARLOW: "People are demanding justice, Doctor. This won't look good."

Mrs. Weiss is brought to your lab. Despite her confusion, the extraction proceeds. The memory is vivid: her husband's killer clearly identifiable.

In court, the memory evidence proves decisive. The accused is convicted.

Then leaked footage of Mrs. Weiss's memoryâ€”including intimate moments with her husbandâ€”appears online.

* [Publicly denounce the leak, investigate internally]
    ~ it = it + 2  // Commitment to truth
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Team trust strained by investigation
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Attempting to minimize harm
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Pursuing accountability
    
    You hold a press conference condemning the violation and launch an investigation.
    
    MRS. WEISS'S DAUGHTER: "My mother's dignity was stolen twiceâ€”once by a murderer, once by science."

Your lab becomes divided. Dr. Park resigns, publicly criticizing your decisions.

DR. PARK: "We've created a technology that violates the most private human domain without adequate safeguards."

Meanwhile, the military expresses interest in MemEx for interrogation applications.

* [Refuse military applications entirely]
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Preventing potential harm
    ~ sp = sp + 2  // Protecting mental sanctity
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Declining potential funding/resources
    ~ al = al - 1  // Opposing governmental authority
    
    "MemEx will never be used for interrogation. That line is non-negotiable."
    
    Your stance costs significant funding but earns respect from human rights organizations.
