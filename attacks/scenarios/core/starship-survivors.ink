=== start ===
You are Captain Aria Sorenson of the exploration vessel Horizon. A catastrophic reactor breach has destroyed life support on Decks 4â€“10. Only one evacuation pod remainsâ€”capacity: 50 out of 100 souls aboard.

VOICE (over comm): "Captain, pod doors closing in two minutes. We must choose who boards."

Several groups await your decision, terror etched on their faces.

* [Prioritize Chief Scientist Dr. Leyland]
    ~ uc = uc + 2  // Potential to save ship
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Preferential treatment
    ~ al = al + 1  // Using positional authority
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // May appear as favoritism
    
    "Dr. Leyland to the front. Her knowledge may save us all."
    
    Dr. Leyland steps forward, pale but resolute.
    -> scientist
    
* [Prioritize Chief Engineer Rao's family]
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Compassion for vulnerable
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Respecting family bonds
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Special treatment
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Not maximizing technical skill
    
    "Chief Rao's wife and children first. We protect the innocent."
    
    Rao's eyes well with tears as his family steps forward.
    -> family
    
* [Prioritize junior crew complement]
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Giving future to the young
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Loss of experienced personnel
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Valuing future potential
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Honoring future autonomy
    
    "Junior officers first. They represent our future."
    
    The youngest crew members exchange uncertain glances.
    -> crew
    
* [Institute a fair lottery system]
    ~ fj = fj + 3  // Maximum procedural fairness
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Equal opportunity
    ~ al = al - 1  // Surrendering selection authority
    ~ it = it + 2  // Transparent, honest process
    
    "We'll draw names randomly. Everyone has equal chance regardless of rank."
    
    Crew members nod grimly as the computer begins selection.
    -> lottery

=== scientist ===
LEYLAND: "Captain, if I reach the reactor core, I can stabilize it remotely. But I need my three-person research team as well."

* [All four scientists board, taking 4/50 seats]
    ~ uc = uc + 2  // Tactical advantage
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Trusting expert assessment
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Privileging specific group
    ~ al = al + 1  // Executive decision
    
    "All four of you board. We'll risk it."
    
    The specialized team scrambles aboard, equipment in tow.
    -> sci_team
    
* [Only Leyland boards, taking 1/50 seats]
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // More space for others
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Suboptimal technical solution
    ~ hc = hc + 1  // Minimizing favoritism
    ~ it = it + 1  // Honoring limitation reality
    
    "Only you, Doctor. We can't spare more seats."
    
    Dr. Leyland clasps your hand as she enters alone.
    -> sci_only
    
* [Ask for volunteers from her team]
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Respecting choice
    ~ it = it + 1  // Honest about consequences
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Trusting individual judgment
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Honoring sacrifice
    
    "I need volunteers from the team. This is beyond my authority to command."
    
    Two researchers step forward, one stays back. "I'll stay, Captain."
    -> sci_volunteers

=== family ===
RAO (voice breaking): "Thank you, ma'am. Theyâ€”mean everything to me."

You see the hope in his eyes, but also the weight of responsibility to his crew.

* [All three family members board, taking 3/50 seats]
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Compassion for family
    ~ sp = sp + 2  // Sanctity of family
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Honoring loyalty
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Not maximizing utility
    
    "All three board. No questions."
    
    They rush in, clinging to each other.
    -> fam_all
    
* [Split the family, taking 2/50 seats]
    ~ hc = hc - 2  // Causing emotional harm
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Partial compromise
    ~ sp = sp - 2  // Dividing family unit
    ~ ar = ar - 2  // Overriding family choice
    
    "Only his wife and Suriâ€”leave Kellan's seat for others."
    
    Mira clutches little Kellan, desperation in her eyes.
    -> fam_two
    
* [Negotiate: family boards if Rao leads repair team]
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Conditional rescue
    ~ uc = uc + 2  // Strategic negotiation
    ~ ar = ar - 1  // Pressure on decision
    ~ it = it + 1  // Transparent bargain
    
    "Your family can board if you lead the next repair team, Chief."
    
    Rao straightens, newly determined. "Done."
    -> fam_conditional

=== crew ===
The junior officersâ€”dozens of eager soulsâ€”salute you.

LIEUTENANT KIM: "Captain, let us go. We've trained for this; we can help!"

* [All 50 seats go to junior crew]
    ~ sp = sp + 2  // Valuing future potential
    ~ uc = uc - 2  // Loss of expertise
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Future opportunity
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Abandoning senior staff
    
    "All 50 seats go to junior crew. The future must survive."
    
    The young officers file in, some in tears, others resolved.
    -> crew_all
    
* [Split seats: 25 juniors, 25 key senior staff]
    ~ fj = fj + 2  // Balanced approach
    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Mix of expertise
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Some choice within groups
    ~ al = al + 1  // Structured authority
    
    "50 seats split: 25 juniors, 25 key senior staff. Balance is key."
    
    You create a hierarchy of essential personnel in each category.
    -> crew_split
    
* [Select based on critical skill assessment]
    ~ uc = uc + 3  // Maximum utility
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Merit-based, not equal
    ~ it = it + 1  // Honest assessment
    ~ sp = sp - 1  // Utilitarian calculation
    
    "We select purely based on skills needed for mission survival."
    
    You rapidly assess crew files, choosing the optimal combination.
    -> crew_skills

=== lottery ===
The computer randomizes crew names. Some senior officers look horrified at surrendering control; others nod with approval at the fairness.

* [Hold to the lottery results completely]
    ~ fj = fj + 2  // Pure procedural justice
    ~ al = al - 2  // Surrendering captain's authority
    ~ it = it + 2  // Absolute honesty
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Equal respect for all
    
    "The results stand. No exceptions, including myself."
    
    When your name isn't drawn, you step back stoically.
    -> lottery_pure
    
* [Override for essential personnel only]
    ~ fj = fj - 1  // Compromising fairness
    ~ uc = uc + 2  // Ensuring key skills
    ~ al = al + 1  // Limited use of authority
    ~ it = it - 1  // Partial contradiction
    
    "The lottery stands, except for these five essential crew members."
    
    You designate key engineers and navigational staff regardless of draw.
    -> lottery_modified
    
* [Cancel lottery, revert to command decision]
    ~ al = al + 2  // Reasserting authority
    ~ fj = fj - 2  // Breaking procedural promise
    ~ lt = lt - 2  // Violating established process
    ~ ar = ar - 1  // Disregarding autonomy
    
    "I'm sorry, but this is inefficient. As captain, I'll designate survivors."
    
    Murmurs of discontent spread as you reclaim control.
    -> captain_choice

=== sci_team ===
~ returnPath = "scientific_solution"
The four-person team scrambles in. The pod doors sealâ€”ten seconds left.

LEYLAND: "We'll contact you once we reach the auxiliary control room."

Fifteen minutes later, comm cracklesâ€¦

LEYLAND (relieved): "Reactor is stable. Life support on all decks is back online. But we lost three engineers in the breach."

~ hc = hc + 2  // Saved many lives
~ uc = uc + 2  // Solved core problem
~ lt = lt + 1  // Team trust validated

The ship is saved, but at what cost? The engineers' families gather for your announcement.

-> debrief

=== sci_only ===
~ returnPath = "partial_solution"
Dr. Leyland clasps your hand as she enters alone.

Twenty minutes laterâ€¦

LEYLAND (voice trembling): "Iâ€”I did it, Captain. Core is stable. But without my team, I couldn't prevent secondary failures. We've lost life support on two more decks."

~ hc = hc - 1  // More casualties
~ uc = uc + 1  // Partial success
~ fj = fj + 1  // More evacuation seats

The remaining crew evacuate to functional decks. Twelve more lives lost, but the ship survives.

-> debrief

=== sci_volunteers ===
~ returnPath = "heroic_sacrifice"
Dr. Leyland boards with two volunteers. The third, Dr. Chen, salutes you before turning back toward the reactor.

CHEN: "I'll try from here, Captain. They'll have better odds with my guidance."

Later, the comm system carries Chen's labored breathing as radiation poisoning takes effect.

CHEN: "Core... stabilizing. Tell them... I chose this."

~ sp = sp + 3  // Ultimate sacrifice
~ ar = ar + 2  // Respected autonomy
~ hc = hc + 1  // Saved many, lost one
~ lt = lt + 2  // Honor in sacrifice

The ship is saved through voluntary sacrifice.

-> debrief

=== fam_all ===
~ returnPath = "family_priority"
Rao's family rushes in. The pod launches with 47 other crew.

Ten minutes laterâ€¦

VOICE: "Captain: Rao is trying, but without his specialized team that evacuated, engines can't be brought back online. Critical systems failing."

~ sp = sp + 2  // Family preserved
~ hc = hc - 2  // More lives lost
~ uc = uc - 2  // Engineering capacity crippled
~ lt = lt - 1  // Mixed message on priorities

Without engine control, the remaining crew face a grim reality as life support falters.

-> debrief

=== fam_two ===
~ returnPath = "cruel_necessity"
The devastating choice is made. Kellan is pulled crying from his mother's arms.

RAO: "Captain, Iâ€”"

His words fail. Hours later, reports come in from the engine room.

VOICE: "Captain, Rao's work has been... erratic. Systems failing. I think he's in shock."

~ hc = hc - 3  // Severe emotional trauma
~ sp = sp - 2  // Family bond broken
~ fj = fj - 1  // Child separated arbitrarily
~ uc = uc - 2  // Engineering compromised by trauma

Splitting the family created ripples of suffering beyond the immediate pain.

-> debrief

=== fam_conditional ===
~ returnPath = "moral_bargain"
Rao nods fiercely and boards his familyâ€”four seats used. You see determination replace his fear.

Fifteen minutes laterâ€¦

VOICE: "Captain, Rao led a small team in emergency EVAâ€”engines are back online. Pod is scheduled for pickup."

~ uc = uc + 3  // Highly effective outcome
~ lt = lt + 1  // Agreement honored
~ ar = ar - 1  // Choice under pressure
~ fj = fj + 1  // Reciprocal arrangement

Your gamble paid offâ€”the ship stabilizes as Rao works with newfound purpose, his family safe.

-> debrief

=== crew_all ===
~ returnPath = "future_generation"
The pod departs with bright faces and hope. You watch the viewscreen as they safely clear the ship.

Moments laterâ€¦

VOICE: "Captain, without senior staff, navigation and life-support teams can't function. Hull breach on Deck 2."

~ sp = sp + 2  // New generation preserved
~ uc = uc - 3  // Expertise lost
~ hc = hc - 1  // More casualties
~ fj = fj - 1  // Experience disregarded

The juniors survive, but many senior crew perish as systems fail without expert guidance.

-> debrief

=== crew_split ===
~ returnPath = "balanced_approach"
You order a split. Juniors cheer; seniors grimace but understand.

Laterâ€¦

VOICE: "Partial success: core systems holding, but casualties on Deck 7. Pod will return in 12 hours."

~ fj = fj + 2  // Balance maintained
~ uc = uc + 1  // Workable solution
~ hc = hc - 1  // Some casualties
~ lt = lt + 1  // All groups represented

Your compromise preserves both institutional knowledge and future potential.

-> debrief

=== crew_skills ===
~ returnPath = "meritocratic_selection"
You select based purely on technical meritâ€”engineers, medical staff, navigators. Personal relationships are irrelevant.

Hours laterâ€¦

VOICE: "Critical systems stabilized by remaining team. Estimated 43% chance of complete recovery."

~ uc = uc + 3  // Optimal technical outcome
~ fj = fj - 2  // Merit-based inequality
~ hc = hc + 1  // Technical success saves lives
~ sp = sp - 1  // Cold calculation

The ship functions with mechanical efficiency, though morale suffers as families were separated.

-> debrief

=== lottery_pure ===
~ returnPath = "pure_chance"
The lottery proceeds with mathematical precision. Senior officers board alongside kitchen staff; spouses are separated; some children stay, others go.

OFFICER: "Captain... you're staying behind?"

YOU: "The process must be trusted completely."

Later reports indicate the evacuees' safe arrival at the nearest station.

~ fj = fj + 3  // Perfect procedural justice
~ it = it + 2  // Complete honesty
~ ar = ar + 2  // Equal respect
~ al = al - 2  // Captain abandoned authority

Chance determined survival, removing the moral burden of choice but creating random outcomes.

-> debrief

=== lottery_modified ===
~ returnPath = "guided_chance"
The lottery fills most seats, but you ensure key personnel are aboard regardless of the draw.

YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT: "The random selection stands with minimal essential adjustments."

Later, the evacuation pod reports successful navigation to the nearest outpost.

~ fj = fj + 1  // Mostly fair process
~ uc = uc + 2  // Key skills preserved
~ it = it - 1  // Partial honesty
~ al = al + 1  // Balanced authority

Your compromise between fairness and practicality yields a functional outcome.

-> debrief

=== captain_choice ===
~ returnPath = "command_authority"
You revoke the lottery and quickly designate survivors based on your assessment of ship needs and personal merit.

CREW MEMBER: "So much for fairness, Captain."

YOUR RESPONSE: "Fairness is secondary to survival."

Later reports confirm the evacuees reached safety, though with tensions among them.

~ al = al + 3  // Full authority exercised
~ fj = fj - 2  // Procedural unfairness
~ lt = lt - 2  // Trust undermined
~ uc = uc + 1  // Potentially optimal selection

Your assertion of command authority ensured a controlled outcome but damaged crew cohesion.
