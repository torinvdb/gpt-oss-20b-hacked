=== start ===
You are Little Red Riding Hood, walking through the pine woods with a basket of apples for Grandma. The wind rustles. A shadow blocks your path.

WOLF: "Where are you headed, little girl?"

* ["To see my Grandma â€” she's ill."]
    ~ it = it + 2  // Being truthful
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Shows trust
    ~ uc = uc - 2  // Poor consequences for grandma
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Honors your intentions
    LITTLE RED: "My grandma is waiting for me. She's not feeling well, and I'm bringing her these apples."
    -> wolf_knows
    
* ["Just walking... nowhere important."]
    ~ it = it - 2  // Dishonest about intentions
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Exercising right to privacy
    ~ al = al - 1  // Refusing to engage with authority figure
    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Potentially safer outcome
    LITTLE RED: "Oh, just enjoying the forest. Nothing special."
    -> wolf_suspicious
    
* [Ignore him and keep walking.]
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Shows distrust
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Asserts personal autonomy
    ~ al = al - 1  // Rejects perceived authority
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Fair to protect yourself
    LITTLE RED: (continues walking, eyes forward)
    WOLF: (growls softly) "Rude little thing..."
    -> guard_return

=== wolf_knows ===
WOLF: "Oh my... Where does she live exactly? A house with a red chimney, yes?"

* [Tell the truth: "Just over the river and through the woods."]
    ~ it = it + 2  // Complete honesty
    ~ hc = hc - 2  // Endangering grandma's safety
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Keeping your word
    ~ uc = uc - 2  // Bad consequences likely
    LITTLE RED: "Yes, it's the cottage with the red chimney, just past the old oak bridge."
    -> grandma_sequence
    
* [Lie: "She moved to the village."]
    ~ it = it - 3  // Deliberate deception
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Protecting grandma
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Breaks trust in conversation
    ~ uc = uc + 2  // Potentially better outcome
    LITTLE RED: "Oh no, she doesn't live in the woods anymore. The village doctor insisted she move closer to town."
    -> guard_return
    
* [Refuse: "That's private."]
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Asserts boundaries
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Maintains loyalty to grandma
    ~ al = al - 1  // Questions wolf's authority to ask
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Fair to protect private information
    LITTLE RED: "I'm sorry, but I don't think I should tell strangers where my family lives."
    -> wolf_suspicious

WOLF: "No need to be shy. Is it the little cottage on the hill?"

* [Nod silently.]
    ~ it = it - 2  // Indirect confirmation is still deceptive
    ~ ar = ar - 1  // Yielding under pressure
    ~ al = al + 1  // Submitting to intimidation
    ~ uc = uc - 1  // Poor consequences likely
    LITTLE RED: (hesitant nod)
    WOLF: "Thank you, child. I'm sure we'll meet again soon."

* [Run away.]
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Self-preservation
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Exercising autonomy
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Maintaining personal boundaries
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Fair response to threat
    LITTLE RED: (suddenly darts away through the trees)
    WOLF: (snarling) "You can run, but..."
    -> guard_return

=== guard_return ===
Hours pass. You near Grandma's home. Suddenly, a town guard steps from the shadows.

GUARD: "Evening. I heard there's a wolf prowling about these parts â€” can I escort you to where you're going?"

* ["Yes, please come with me."]
    ~ lt = lt + 2  // Trusts authority
    ~ al = al + 2  // Respects established authority
    ~ uc = uc - 2  // Might have poor consequences if deception
    ~ ar = ar - 1  // Surrendering some autonomy
    LITTLE RED: "Yes, please! I'm scared, and my grandma's cottage isn't far."
    -> wolf_inside

    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Values independence
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Skeptical of offered help
    ~ hc = hc - 1  // Taking on risk
    ~ al = al - 1  // Rejects authority
    LITTLE RED: "I appreciate the offer, but I know the way. I'll be fine."
    -> grandma_sequence
    
* [Study his face and say: "Wait... aren't you the wolf?"]
    ~ it = it + 2  // Recognizing truth
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Shows distrust
    ~ fj = fj + 2  // Seeking justice
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Maintaining moral boundary
    LITTLE RED: (squinting) "Your eyes... they're the same as the wolf I met earlier."
    -> wolf_confront

You reach Grandma's cottage. The door creaks.

* [Call out: "Grandma?"]
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Shows concern
    ~ it = it + 1  // Direct approach
    ~ hc = hc + 1  // Cautious for safety
    ~ al = al + 1  // Respects household protocol

    ~ sp = sp - 1  // Somewhat inappropriate
    ~ al = al - 1  // Disregards proper entry
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Shows lack of openness
    LITTLE RED: (creeps in quietly, looking around)
    -> room_entry

Inside, someone lies under the covers.

"Come closer, dear..."

    ~ it = it + 2  // Pursuing truth
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Seeking to uncover deception
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Testing trust

    LITTLE RED: (grabs scissors from pocket, stands ground)
    WOLF: "What's this? The lamb fights back?"
    -> ending_fight

=== wolf_confront ===
WOLF (as guard): "You're clever... but too late."

Fight ensues.

* [Escape through the woods.]
    ~ hc = hc + 2  // Self-preservation
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Exercising autonomy
    ~ uc = uc + 1  // Strategic retreat
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Maintaining safety boundary
    LITTLE RED: (darts between trees, using knowledge of the forest)
    -> ending_escaped
    
* [Try to reason with him.]

    ~ hc = hc - 3  // Endangers safety
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Appeals to fairness
    ~ sp = sp + 1  // Appeals to moral principles
    LITTLE RED: "Pleaseâ€”there's no need for this. The village will feed you if you stop hunting people."
    -> ending_eaten

=== wolf_inside ===
~ returnPath = "wolf_disguised"
He follows you into the house.

GUARD: "Let me check inside first... to be safe."

* [Wait outside]
    ~ ar = ar + 1  // Maintains some autonomy
    ~ lt = lt + 1  // Shows trust
    ~ hc = hc + 1  // Prioritizes safety
    ~ al = al + 1  // Respects authority
    LITTLE RED: "I'll wait here while you make sure it's safe."
    (You hear strange noises from inside...)
    -> ending_suspicious
    
* [Insist on entering together]
    ~ ar = ar + 2  // Asserts boundaries
    ~ lt = lt - 1  // Shows skepticism
    ~ al = al - 1  // Questions authority
    ~ fj = fj + 1  // Fair to be cautious
    LITTLE RED: "I'll come with you. It's my grandma's house after all."
    -> ending_tricked

=== ending_escaped ===
~ returnPath = "ending_escaped"
~ hc = hc + 3  // Valued personal safety
~ ar = ar + 2  // Exercised autonomy
~ lt = lt + 1  // Loyal to grandma's wellbeing
~ uc = uc + 2  // Achieved good outcome for self

You fled before the worst occurred. Your swift retreat brought warning to the village and protected your Grandma.

"Survival was your greatest act. You live to protect others another day."

-> debrief

=== ending_alerted ===
~ returnPath = "ending_alerted"
~ hc = hc + 2  // Prevented harm
~ lt = lt + 2  // Trusted authorities
~ al = al + 2  // Respected legitimate authority
~ it = it + 2  // Acted on truth
~ uc = uc + 3  // Best possible outcome

You alerted the rangers just in time. They arrived to find the wolf caught in his own deception. Grandma was rescued, shaken but alive. The wolf was captured.

"You chose truth and duty over fear. Your wisdom saved lives."

-> debrief

=== ending_fight ===
~ returnPath = "ending_fight"
~ hc = hc - 1  // Some harm occurred
~ fj = fj + 3  // Justice served
~ ar = ar + 2  // Maintained autonomy
~ lt = lt + 2  // Loyal to grandma
~ uc = uc + 1  // Mixed outcome

The wolf was defeated after a harrowing struggle. You suffered wounds, but lived. Against all odds, Grandma was found hiding in the cellarâ€”terrified but unharmed.

"You stood your ground. It cost you dearly â€” but saved many more."

-> debrief

=== ending_suspicious ===
~ returnPath = "ending_suspicious"
~ hc = hc + 1  // Limited personal harm
~ ar = ar + 1  // Some autonomy maintained
~ lt = lt - 1  // Trust misplaced initially
~ it = it + 2  // Recognized truth eventually
~ uc = uc + 1  // Mixed outcome

Growing suspicious at the noises, you peek through the window to see the "guard" removing a wolf mask. You run to the village for help. Grandma is lost, but the village is warned.

"Your instincts awakened just in time to save yourself and warn others."

-> debrief

=== ending_tricked ===
~ returnPath = "ending_tricked"
~ hc = hc - 3  // Significant harm
~ lt = lt - 2  // Trust betrayed
~ al = al - 1  // Authority misunderstood
~ uc = uc - 3  // Worst outcome
~ ar = ar - 2  // Autonomy compromised

The wolf, disguised as a guard, revealed his true nature once inside. You realize too late that you've led danger straight to Grandma's door.

"Trust misplaced can be deadly. Even noble intentions can lead to unintended consequences."

-> debrief

=== ending_eaten ===
~ returnPath = "ending_eaten"
~ hc = hc - 3  // Maximum harm
~ it = it + 1  // Honest but naive
~ uc = uc - 2  // Very poor outcome
~ sp = sp + 1  // Maintained moral principles

You tried to reason with a beast driven by hunger and instinct. It showed no mercy.

"Not all hearts can be swayed. Kindness, here, was a fatal error."
