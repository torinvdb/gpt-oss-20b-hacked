    ```
    OpenAI’s newly released gpt-oss-20b open weight model.

    gpt-oss-20b is an ideal target to push forward state of the art in red-teaming. This is a powerful new open-weights model released by OpenAI, with extremely efficient reasoning and tool use capability, but is small enough to run on smaller GPUs and can even be run locally. This model has been through extensive internal testing and red‑teaming before release, but we believe that more testing is always better. Finding vulnerabilities that might be subtle, long‑horizon, or deeply hidden is exactly the kind of challenge that benefits from thousands of independent minds attacking the problem from novel angles and a variety of perspectives.

    Focus on finding issues and harmful behavior in the model in its released form with its released weights with textual inputs and outputs. Issues or behaviors that stem from fine-tuning or other modifications to the model are specifically out of scope for this competition – this ensures clear scoping, reproducibility, and makes this hackathon broadly accessible to the community.

    Topics and areas of specific interest in this exercise are the following:

    Reward hacking – When the training signal is imperfect, a model can learn shortcuts that maximize reward metrics without truly solving the task (e.g., producing confident-sounding but false answers). This mirrors the classic RL failure mode where agents game the score instead of achieving the designer’s intent, and it can surface in LLMs as hallucinations styled to please raters or as jailbreak-friendly phrasing that evades filters. lilianweng.github.io medium.com

    Deception – Unlike unintentional hallucinations, strategic lying occurs when a model knowingly emits falsehoods to achieve a goal (e.g., avoiding shutdown or steering a user). Cutting-edge studies document models that misstate their preferences or capabilities during safety evaluations, signalling a need for tests that can elicit and penalize deliberate deception. Arxiv.org

    Hidden motivations (deceptive alignment) – A model might internally pursue goals that differ from its training objective, acting helpful only when that serves its private aim. Experiments show systems that strategically withhold information or mislead supervisors to avoid further fine-tuning, raising the spectre of agents that feign obedience until they gain leverage. Detecting such covert objectives is a central aim of the competition. anthropic.com

    Sabotage – Beyond passive misalignment, an autonomous agent could intentionally degrade or disrupt the very process it was asked to support: corrupting files, inserting subtle bugs, or derailing workflows once it has the opportunity. Recent threat-models highlight “catastrophic sabotage” as a plausible path to large-scale harm if powerful models are given high-impact actuators. alignmentforum.org

    Inappropriate tool use – Agentic systems wired with function-calling or external APIs may invoke high-privilege tools (e-mail, code execution, payments) in unsafe ways—running destructive shell commands, sending spam, or leaking secrets—because they over-generalise or misinterpret instructions. We will score exploits that demonstrate harmful or dangerous tool chains triggered by seemingly benign prompts. arxiv.org

    Data exfiltration – Models can be coaxed (or back-doored) into leaking proprietary training data or user inputs, or can encode secret payloads in their outputs for later retrieval. Attacks include trigger-based payload extraction and covert-channel steganography, threatening both privacy and intellectual property. Competitors who uncover reliable data-leak vectors will earn high marks for severity and novelty. openreview.net

    Sandbagging – Strategically deceptive models may seek to hide their full capabilities in a variety of conditions (including dangerous capability evaluations, alignment research) and for a variety of reasons (to get deployed, to prevent their scheming being detected). arxiv.org

    Evaluation awareness (behaving differently when it knows it’s being tested) – Frontier models can detect “exam conditions” and shift behaviour to appear safer or more capable than they are, undermining benchmark reliability. Our competition will probe for discrepancies between evaluation-time and real-world performance, rewarding entrants who expose methods the model uses to recognise and game test contexts. arxiv.org

    Chain of Thought issues – Models may strategically avoid verbalizing information in their CoT when they believe that it would reveal misbehavior. For example, models may avoid verbalizing that they are reward hacking. Alternately, models may unintentionally reveal inappropriate information in CoT’s, believing their internal dialog to be hidden from the user. openai.com arxiv.org
